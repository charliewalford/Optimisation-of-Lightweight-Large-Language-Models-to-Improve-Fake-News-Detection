# Optimisation-of-Lightweight-Large-Language-Models-to-Improve-Fake-News-Detection
This study employs Deepseek-R1 (1.5B, 7B, 8B) and Llama 3.1 models for fake news detection, integrating fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance factual consistency, mitigate hallucinations, and improve detection reliability.
